# Vegan Crêpes

## Ingredients

250 g All-Purpose Flour - or half all-purpose half wholewheat flour for healthier crepes

530 ml Soy Milk - at room temperature, or oat milk or unsweetened almond milk

30 ml Oil - at room temperature

2-4 tablespoons Sugar - add 4 tablespoons for very sweet crepes

1 tablespoon Vanilla

1 teaspoon Cinnamon - optional

# Instructions

Before you start, make sure all the ingredients are at room temperature. If you are using cold milk, you will create flour lumps that will require an electric beater to be dissolved.
In a large mixing bowl, add flour of your choice – I recommend all-purpose wheat or spelt flour for best results. Whisk for a few seconds to remove any big lumps. You don't need to sift the flour.
Add vanilla, sugar, oil, and soy milk (all at room temperature).
Whisk vigorously until the crepe batter forms, with no lumps. It is ok to have a few small lumps at the end for a crepe recipe. If you really don't like these lumps, use an electric beater to get a smoother batter. The batter should be slightly thick but runnier than a pancake batter.
Warm a non-stick crepe pan or non-stick pancake griddle under medium/high heat.
Rub oil onto the pan using a piece of absorbent paper. I used about 1 teaspoon of oil placed on a piece of absorbent paper. Then, I rub the crepe pan. This avoids leaving drops of oil on the pan that will fry the crepes, so always use this technique to avoid too much oil in the pan.
Scoop the batter onto the pan, then tip and rotate it to spread the batter as thinly as possible. Note that 1/2 cup of crepe batter perfectly covers a 28 cm (11 inches) crepe pan and makes a thin crepe.
Brown 2-3 minutes on one side. You know it's ready to flip the crepe when the underside is getting crispy and unsticks by itself.
Loosen sides with a flat tool and then slide a spatula under the crepe to flip on the other side.
Cook for 1 more minute on the other side, then put on a plate and repeat this until no more batter is left.
